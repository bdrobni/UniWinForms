Finished and tested WinForms application for a mock supermarket cash register and item administration application. Contains login functionality with two user roles with different levels of privilege, a cashier user who can add items to a bill (directly from table or by barcode), remove specific items from the bill, apply discounts and check out items. The administrator user can do all of the above, and also add, alter and remove items in the database. Test user credentials are bdrobni/1234 for the cashier test user and adrobni/5678 for the administrator test user. The test discount's ID is 1 and it applies to item 1 (milk).
